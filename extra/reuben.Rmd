## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r splitting_data}
police_data <- read_csv(here("data/Innocent Deaths caused by Police (All time).csv"))
head(police_data)


set.seed(32)
police_split <- initial_split(police_data, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(police_split)
test_data <- testing(police_split)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r linear_regression}
police_data <- read_csv(here("data/Innocent Deaths caused by Police (All time).csv"))
head(police_data)
police_data <- subset(police_data, select = -c(6, 8, 13, 21, 22, 23, 26))
police_data <- rename(police_data, unique_id = `Unique ID`, name = Name, age = Age, gender = Gender, race = Race, doi = `Date of injury resulting in death (month/day/year)`, state = State, lod_zip_code = `Location of death (zip code)` , lod_county = `Location of death (county)`, latitude = Latitude, longitude = Longitude,  agency_involved = `Agency or agencies involved`, hlof = `Highest level of force`, alleged_weapon = `Alleged weapon`, agressive_movement = `Aggressive physical movement`, fleeing_not_fleeing = `Fleeing/Not fleeing`, dispositions_exclusions =`Dispositions/Exclusions INTERNAL USE, NOT FOR ANALYSIS`, iuof = `Intended use of force (Developing)`, mental_illness = `Foreknowledge of mental illness`)
police_data1 <- police_data %>%
  filter(age < 18)
ggplot(police_data1,
       aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  scale_y_log10()
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
