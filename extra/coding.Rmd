## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
police_data <- read_csv(here("data/Innocent Deaths caused by Police (All time).csv"))
head(police_data)

glimpse(head(police_data))
set.seed(32)
police_split <- initial_split(police_data, prop = 0.8)
train_data <- training(police_split)
test_data <- testing(police_split)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#murder, time, race data 

police_data %>% mutate(year = str_sub(doi,-4,-1)) %>% group_by(year,race) %>% count(year) %>% ggplot(police_data, aes(x = year, fill = race)) + geom_histogra()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r race, echo=FALSE}

```
