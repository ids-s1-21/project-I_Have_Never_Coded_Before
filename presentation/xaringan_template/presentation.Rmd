To see if there is a correlation between dying by the police and being innocent. We started off the presentation thinking there's no correlation.

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}

  mutate(year = str_sub(doi,-4,-1)) %>% 
  mutate(
    race = case_when(

      TRUE ~ race
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(year == 2000 | year == 2010 | year == 2019) %>% filter(race == "African-American/Black" | race == "Asian/Pacific Islander" | race == "European-American/White" | race == 	
"Hispanic/Latino"  | race == 	
"Native American/Alaskan") %>% 
  group_by(year,race)  %>% 
  count(year) %>% 
  mutate(n = case_when(
      year == 2000 & n == 125 ~ 125/34658190,

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
